## ✦ Overview

**VESP Hub** is a gamepass-gated troll/utility script for Arsenal-based Roblox shooters. It features a sleek, dark-themed UI with real-time notifications, animated tab switching, hover effects, and a comprehensive keybind system — all injected into `CoreGui` for persistence.

> 🔒 **Gamepass Locked** — Only accessible to players who own the gamepass. Unauthorized users cannot load or execute the hub.

## ✦ UI Highlights

- **Dark glassmorphic theme** with `#B482FF` accent color
- **5-tab layout** — Combat / Visuals / Move / Player / Config
- **Toast notifications** — pop up bottom-right when toggling features
- **Active feature counter** — live count in the header
- **Animated tab indicators** with smooth transitions
- **Hover glow effects** on every interactive element
- **Draggable window** — click and drag the header
- **Hide toggle** — `Left Alt` smoothly collapses the window

---

## ✦ Keybind System

Every feature has an assignable keybind in the **Config** tab.

1. Open the **Config** tab
2. Click the `—` button next to any feature
3. Press any key or mouse button to assign it
4. Press `Escape` or `Backspace` to clear the bind
5. Your assigned key will **toggle** that feature on/off in real-time

The **Aimbot hold key** is separate — it works as a hold-to-activate, not a toggle.

---

## ✦ Installation

### Method 1 — Direct Execute
Paste the script into your Roblox executor and run it:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vkxd/my-scripts/refs/heads/main/vesp-hub.lua"))()
```

### Method 2 — Local File
Save `vesp-hub.lua` and execute it directly through your executor's file loader.

---

## ✦ Keybinds (Defaults)

| Action | Default Bind |
|---|---|
| Hide / Show UI | `Left Alt` |
| Aimbot Hold | `Right Mouse Button` |
| All others | Unbound (set in Config) |

---

## ✦ Notes on God Mode

> Arsenal and Arsenal-based games process **all damage server-side**. Health is changed by the server and replicated to the client — which means no client-side script can truly prevent incoming damage.

VESP Hub uses three simultaneous methods to minimize death chance:

1. `MaxHealth = math.huge` + `Health = math.huge` loop
2. Invisible `ForceField` parented to your character
3. Attempts to disable local damage scripts

**Recommended strategy:** Combine Aimbot + Trigger Bot + Big Head to eliminate enemies before they can kill you.

| Game Type | Compatibility |
|---|---|
| Arsenal / Arsenal forks | ✅ Supported |
| Standard Roblox FPS | ✅ Supported |
| Server-sided anti-cheat games | ⚠️ Some features limited |
| Filtering Enabled games | ✅ Client-side features work |
